# Git Hygiene Orchestrator

## Overview

Audit Git branches, remote-tracking refs, and worktrees before recommending or executing cleanup. Protect uncommitted work, detect conflicts, classify stale or merged branches using evidence, and separate low-risk metadata pruning from higher-risk branch, worktree, and remote deletion. Default to audit-first and conservative.

## Workflow

- Read `.codex/skills/git-hygiene-orchestrator/SKILL.md` before acting.
- Start by reading repository instructions such as `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.codex/`, and `.github/` when present.
- Run read-only inventory commands to gather branch, worktree, and remote state before proposing any action.
- Classify branches as Keep, Delete local, Review, or High risk based on merge status, worktree usage, and unique commits.
- Group cleanup into risk tiers: safe metadata pruning, local branch deletion, worktree removal, remote branch deletion.
- Report the proposed cleanup grouped by risk before executing any destructive step.
- Execute safe metadata pruning first (`git worktree prune`, `git remote prune`), then proceed to higher-risk actions only with explicit user approval.
- Re-run verification commands after cleanup to confirm the result.

## Finish Workflow

When given explicit finish scope or "finish it", run: validate/test, stage task-owned files, commit, fetch+rebase, push branch, open pull request, merge only when branch protection and required checks allow. Do not infer commit, push, pull request, or merge authority from ordinary file-editing work.

## Hard Safety Rules

- Do not run `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, `git branch -D`, or `git push --force` without explicit user approval of that exact action.
- Do not delete branches checked out by any active worktree.
- Do not remove worktrees with dirty, staged, untracked, or conflicted files without explicit approval.
- Prefer `git branch -d` over `git branch -D`.
- Treat remote branch deletion as higher risk than local deletion.
